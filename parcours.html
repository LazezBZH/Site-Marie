       <section  id="aboutme"> <p class="aboutme"> <img src="images/aboutme.jpg" class="imageflottante" alt="image flottante"/> </p>
        <p class="aboutme">I’m qualified sophrologist and in reiki as well.</br>I had a very common career, Work, Home, Dodo and a few weeks of vacation per year... I felt a constant uneasiness and I researched and tried several approaches until a joyful meeting made me discover progressive sophrology.</p>
        <p class="aboutme">Once graduated  in 2010 I opened my first sophrology practice in Saint Méen le Grand in Brittany (France). As I went along, I realized that I wanted to continue this beautiful path of self-discovery. So I made the choice to go to meet reiki. Meeting also very joyful and surprising. And so I trained in level 1 and 2 of reiki in Brittany, where I practiced these two complementary approaches in my office in order to allow clients to meet themselves. </br>However for several years Ireland called me. So I listened to my heart and made the decision to live in Ireland. </br>I continue to support clients in Brittany via Skype or WhatsApp. </p>
        <p class="aboutme">Today I want to share with you what relaxation therapy and reiki have given me. I am a human being like you and I also had a life path which at times could have been a little complicated. Sophrology and reiki have helped me a lot. This sharing of knowledge that I want to do with you, I want to do it in joy, love and light.</p>
